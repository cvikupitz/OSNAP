This directory contains SQL files/scripts used for the L.O.S.T. database.

The preflight.sh script in the home directory calls the scripts in
this directory before launching the application, so there's no need
to call them here on their own.

* create_tables.sql - Creates the tables for the L.O.S.T. database used by
		      the web application.
