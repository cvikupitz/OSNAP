Additional Notes Following Lecture:
Thank you to everyone for coming to lecture today. I appreciate your engagement with the material and the design discussion we were having with the database was excellent.


I owe you a couple of links to some information online that may be of interest to you...

I found the following page on HTTP when I was preparing the slides today. I haven't read through the page at any depth but from a quick scan the page looked pretty good. It also contains some examples of interacting with a webserver using telnet.

Assignment 3 is a small Flask application. I failed to provide any useful Flask instruction today, instead talking about a bunch high-level networking ideas. A Flask tutorial can be found here:
http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/tutorial

The tutorial covers building a really simple flask application backed by an SQLite database. We will be backing LOST with a Postgres database but hopefully you'll be able to recognize some similarities between the code used to interface with SQLite vs Postgres.


The lecture pretty well followed the slides today and I think the presenter notes in the slides have most of the content... 

The data model discussion is lost to the ages as what we had decided was erased before the next class came in... which is just as well since it lets us try the exercise again. If there is interest, perhaps we should try the exercise via a piazza thread so that there is a documentation trail? Or would there be interest in breaking out the data model exercise as a small group project for a few points of extra credit (I'd need to figure out the scope and crediting strategy so that it doesn't break the scoring system...)?
